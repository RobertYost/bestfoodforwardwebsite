Hey fam welcome to the project. I run this on NPM cause I'm a windows bitch, so yall may have to brew whatever you want to.

But basically this is hosted on Heroku and it runs like a basic html/npm webpage. All of the editing is in index.hbs and the CSS classe are dispered.

Workflow basics:
1. Fork the repo into your own account.
2. Git clone that repo into your computer.
3. Hit "npm install --save" in terminaly while you are in the bff folder
4. To start developing hit npm start in terminal, then go to localhost:3000 in your browser. 
5. I got it all on nodemon so the changes should update localhost automatically.
6. Once you are done with your share of the work, then request a pull request from your repo into master.
7. I will look over the changes and then merge and push to heroku

If you have any questions just slack me!!!
